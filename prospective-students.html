        <p style="text-align: justify;">
		The Visual Intelligence and Multimedia Systems (VIMS) group is a part of the Machine Learning and Vision Laboratory in the School of Computer Science and Technology at ZJNU.
		We are a group of researchers and students from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and related disciplines.
		Aided by knowledge of image processing, computer vision, deep learning, and decision theory, we aimed to do exciting research with new insights to construct intelligent learning systems that can understand scenes and make decisions in diverse environments.
		The VIMS group is led by Dr. Dawei Zhang. 
        </p>

			<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;">
				<font color="#6b5b95" ><b>Visual Representation:</b></font> The success of visual representation through deep convolutional networks has fueled the recent insurgence of interests in artificial intelligence.
				We will continue to study the fundamental problems in computer vision such as image classification, image enhancement, object detection and instance segmentation.
				<br>

			<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;">
				<font color="#6b5b95" ><b>Motion Analysis:</b></font> Complex environments are usually filled with dynamic objects, which is essential to video surveillance, autonomous driving and robotic manipulation, etc.
				So we are currently working on monocular 2D tracking and multi-modal object tracking. 
				<br>

			<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;">
				<font color="#6b5b95" ><b>Deep Learning:</b></font> Although CNNs and ViTs have achieved great success in CV, there are still significant difficulties in practical applications.
				We can formulate those problems as efficient networks, few-​shot learning, self-​supervised learning, adversarial attack, and domain adaptation.
				We will consider those problems from the 'delivery' perspective.

				<font color="#6b5b95" ><b>Multimedia Applications:</b></font> An intelligent system is supposed to make action decisions by sensing and understanding the environment.
				We will study and design real-​time and low-​latency learning systems for navigation/driving/manipulation and medical/education/transportation scenarios.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We are currently looking for <b>one or two</b> self-motivated master students each year to work on interesting research in computer vision,
        such as object detection, visual tracking (2D videos or multi-modal), image super-resolution, fine-grained visual recognition, person re-identification, light-weight neural networks, adversarial attack and other related areas.
        Qualified students will be supported by research assistantships. If you'd like to know our research, please refer to my publications at <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/76/5684-2.html" target="_blank"><font color="#0099ff">this page</font></a>.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
		We prefer the students who have solid mathematical foundations, strong programming skills, and good English abilities (listening, speaking, reading, writing).
		The experiences in research (e.g. projects, academic competition, publications, etc.) will be a benefit.
        If you are highly creative, and interested in the reseach of vision and learning, please send your CV and transcripts of grades to <a href="mailto:davidzhang@zjnu.edu.cn"><font color="#0099ff">davidzhang@zjnu.edu.cn</font></a>
        </p>
		
		<font size="3" ><b>Admissions Commitments:</b></font>
		<ul style="margin-top:5px;">
		
		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;">
				Provide a full range of effective academic guidance in algorithm design, experimental verification, paper writing, patent application, etc,
				so that the students are expected to gain solid professional knowledge, strong practical ability, broad academic vision.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;">
				Provide you enjoyable scientific research atmosphere, comfortable research environment, generous allowance/rewards, and efficient gpu computing equipment.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; text-align: justify;">
				For the students who succesfully get their papers accepted by top conferences, we will financially support them to participate in the conferences.
				Extra bonus is also distributed.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		
		This should be enough to get you started research. Happy coding!
