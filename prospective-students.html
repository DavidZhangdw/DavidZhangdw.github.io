		I usually look for <b>one or two</b> self-motivated master students each year (starting in Fall) to work on interesting research in computer vision, such as objec detection, visual tracking (in 2D videos or multi-modal), image super-resolution, fine-grained image retrieval, person re-identification, light-weight neural networks, adversarial attack and defense and other related areas. Qualified students will be supported by research assistantships. If you'd like to know my research work, please refer to my publications at <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/76/5684-2.html" target="_blank"><font color="#0099ff">this page</font></a>.
		
		<br><br>

		We prefer the students who have solid mathematical foundations, strong programming skills, and good English abilities (listening/speaking/reading/writing).
		The experiences in research (e.g. academic competition, publications, extracurricular academic activities, etc.) will be a benefit.
                If you are highly creative, have good grades/coding skill and interested in computer vision research, please do not hesitate to send your CV and transcripts of grades to <a href="mailto:davidzhang@zjnu.edu.cn"><font color="#0099ff">davidzhang@zjnu.edu.cn</font></a>

		Commitments:
		<ul style="margin-top:5px;">
		
		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				Provide a full range of effective guidance in algorithm design, experimental verification, paper writing, patent application, etc,
				so the students are expected to gain solid professional knowledge, rigorous scientific thinking, strong practical ability, broad academic vision.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				Provide you enjoyable scientific research atmosphere, comfortable research environment, generous allowance/rewards, and efficient computing equipment.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				For the students who succesfully get their papers accepted by top conferences, we will financially support them to participate in the conferences.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		
		This should be enough to get you started research. Happy coding!

	Note: In addition to master students, motivated undergraduate students within ZJNU are also welcome. If you're interested in conducting reseach, please contact me.
