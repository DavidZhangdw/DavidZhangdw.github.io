		The Visual Intelligence and Multimedia Systems (VIMS) group is a part of the Machine Learning and Vision Laboratory in the School of Computer Science and Technology at ZJNU.
		We are a group of researchers and students from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and related disciplines.
		Aided by knowledge of image processing, computer vision, deep learning, and decision theory, we aimed to do exciting research with new insights to construct intelligent learning systems that can understand scenes and make decisions in diverse environments.
		The VIMS group is led by Dr. Dawei Zhang.

		<font size="3" ><b>Research Fields:</b></font>
		<ul style="margin-top:5px;">
		
		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				<b>Visual Representation:</b> The success of visual representation through deep convolutional networks has fueled the recent insurgence of interests and hypes in artificial intelligence.
				We will study the fundamental problems in computer vision such as image classification, image enhancement, object detection and instance segmentation.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				<b>Motion Analysis:</b> Complex environments are usually filled with dynamic objects, which is essential for video surveillance, autonomous driving and robotic manipulation.
				So we have been working on monocular 2D and multi-modal object tracking.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				<b>Deep Learning:</b> We have validated the great success of CNNs and ViT, but also exist great difficulties in real applications.
				We can formulate those problems in terms of efficient networks, few-​shot learning, self-​supervised learning, adversarial attack, and domain adaptation.
				We are currently working on those problems from the "delivery" perspective.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				<b>Multimedia Applications:</b> An intelligent system is supposed to make action decisions by sensing and understanding the environment.
				We will study and design real-​time and low-​latency learning systems for navigation/driving/manipulation and medical/education/transportation scenarios.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		
		I am currently looking for <b>one or two</b> self-motivated master students each year to work on interesting research in computer vision, such as objec detection, visual tracking (2D videos or multi-modal), image super-resolution, fine-grained image retrieval, person re-identification, light-weight neural networks, adversarial attack and defense and other related areas. Qualified students will be supported by research assistantships. If you'd like to know my research work, please refer to my publications at <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/76/5684-2.html" target="_blank"><font color="#0099ff">this page</font></a>.
		
		<br><br>

		We prefer the students who have solid mathematical foundations, strong programming skills, and good English abilities (listening/speaking/reading/writing).
		The experiences in research (e.g. projects, academic competition, publications, etc.) will be a benefit.
                If you are highly creative, have good grades/coding skill and interested in computer vision research, please do not hesitate to send your CV and transcripts of grades to <a href="mailto:davidzhang@zjnu.edu.cn"><font color="#0099ff">davidzhang@zjnu.edu.cn</font></a>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<font size="3" ><b>Admissions Commitments:</b></font>
		<ul style="margin-top:5px;">
		
		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				Provide a full range of effective guidance in algorithm design, experimental verification, paper writing, patent application, etc,
				so the students are expected to gain solid professional knowledge, rigorous scientific thinking, strong practical ability, broad academic vision.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				Provide you enjoyable scientific research atmosphere, comfortable research environment, generous allowance/rewards, and efficient computing equipment.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p style="line-height: 120%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				For the students who succesfully get their papers accepted by top conferences, we will financially support them to participate in the conferences.
				<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		
		This should be enough to get you started research. Happy coding!
		<br><br>
	
	Note: In addition to master students, motivated undergraduate students within ZJNU are also welcome. If you're interested in conducting reseach, please contact me.
